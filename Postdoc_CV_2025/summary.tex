\begin{justify}
{I am an early-career postdoctoral researcher specializing in advanced electron microscopy with a materials science background. I employ aberration-corrected STEM to link atomic structure and composition to material properties across multiple length scales. My expertise includes multidimensional imaging, analytical techniques, STEM simulations, in-situ nanomechanics, and correlative approaches for comprehensive material characterization. \\

My PhD work on grain boundary engineering in titanium, including the discovery of segregation-induced phase transitions, culminated in a Science publication (2024). As a postdoc at MPIE, I expanded into hydrogen embrittlement mechanisms in particle-reinforced high-entropy alloys, combining advanced characterization with mechanical testing. Currently at EMPA, I employ in-situ S/TEM techniques to investigate deformation mechanisms across diverse material systems, from single crystals to complex multilayered architectures, including nanolaminates and thin films. Beyond research, I am committed to teaching and mentoring, open science practices, and active science communication through interactive web-based tools and educational materials.}
